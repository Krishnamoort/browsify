Browserify is a module bundler.A module bundler is a tool that takes pieces of JavaScript 
and their dependencies and bundles them into a single file, usually for use in the browser. 

Tsify is Browserify plugin for compiling TypeScript files.

Why u need a module bundler-> One of the primary reason is to reduce number of server request which in turn reduce loading time of webpages and better user experience.
each of those files has to be included in your main HTML file in a <script> tag, which is then loaded by the browser when a user visits your home page. Having separate <script> tags for each file means that the browser has to load each file individually: one… by… one, which is very time consuming.
With this u can load single javascript file in html page 
<script src="bundle.js"></script> 
instead of several different javascript files there by reducing number of server of requests.

Below demo steps will compile ts files and bundle them into single .js file
***************************************************************************

Steps->
step 1. 
Create Browserify folder.
npm init -y
step 2. 
Install Tsify using NPM (Node.js Package Manager) using the following command:
npm install tsify
step 3. 
To install Browserify ->
npm install -g browserify

step 4.
create tsconfig.json file by->
tsc --init

step 5.
In tsconfig.json file do below changes(where main.ts is main entry of an application)->
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "commonjs",
        "moduleResolution": "node",
	      "sourceMap": true
    },
    "files": [              
        "./main.ts"
    ]
}

step 6.
Create product.ts in Browserify folder and add following source code in it->
export class Product {
 
    public Id : number=99;
    public Title : string="Books";
    public Price : number=8000;    
  }

step 7.
Create main.ts in Browserify folder and add following source code in it->

export { };
import {Product} from './product';
let value1 = 5;
let value2 =10;
console.log(value1+value2);
function getProduct(){
    let p = new Product();
    p.Id = 2;
    p.Price= 5000;
    p.Title="Cricket Bat";   
    return p;      
  }
  var p1=getProduct();
  console.log(p1.Title); 

step 8.
Use the following command to compile your code and output the result in a file named bundle.js.
browserify main.ts -p [ tsify --noImplicitAny ] > bundle.js

This bundle.js file can be transported to any other machine/folder and executed independently 
where as same can not be done with main.ts file(main.ts file will need product.ts as well).
